# Project Description: Decentralized Pre-Print Server (Basic Metadata Storage)

This project aims to create a basic, decentralized version of a pre-print server. Instead of storing the pre-print documents themselves on the blockchain (which would be very expensive), we'll focus on storing the *metadata* of the pre-prints on a Vyper smart contract. The actual documents will be stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a decentralized storage network.

### **Project Tasks:**

1. **Vyper Smart Contract Development (Moccasin):**
    - **Define the Data Structure:**
    - **Implement Contract Functions:**
    - **Testing:**
2. **Rust Command-Line Tool Development:**
    - **IPFS Integration:**
    - **User Input:**
    - **Interact with Vyper Contract:**
    - **Error Handling:**
3. **Deployment and Testing:**
    - **Deploy the Vyper Contract:**
    - **Test the System:**
